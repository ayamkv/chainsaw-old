It's a python script that posts a frame (images) from 
chainsaw man pv in order every 6-7 hours

### üì¶ Storage

The image files are huge, so i decided to upload them on **dropbox** 
> since they have an easier api to implement , i think

using dropbox api we can download the image, and then delete the image when we're done.
so that's how it will _bypass_ **heroku**'s storage limit.
 
### üñºÔ∏è Banner
there's another feature which is to change the twitter banner
everytime it posts a frame, it would have a background of the current frame blurred
and the logo of chainsaw man. I'm using PIL for the blurred frame and overlay the logo 
on top.


### ‚è≥ Keep On Track

for now, to keep on track/in order i use `current.dat` to count every single time
after it uploads, the file is in dropbox so it needs to download `current.dat`
<br>
```
1208
```
read and edit(update) it with incremental +1 and upload it to **dropbox**.
<br>
`current.dat` +1
```
1209
```

it's used to know we're we are at the moment too.

it's a cheaty system ik. 






### Notes
> the only main files are `app.py` other .py app is just me practicing before i implement it.
